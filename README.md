Neptuniaâ„¢ Virtual Stars Camera Tools (Pre-Release)

Compatible with the April 6th update, which is the latest Steam version as of the day this is being written.

This is a pre-release, fixes to current problems and more features will be added later on.

1. Unzip the "NepVS_CameraTools.CT" somewhere.
2. Run the game and go to the main hub.
3. Minimize the game and run Cheat Engine.
4. Load the cheat table you unzipped earlier.
5. Enable the "Structures (Activate First!)" address in the address list.
6. Minimize Cheat Engine and go back to the game.

Keybinds are in the image bundled with this ZIP file, but feel free to change the currents hotkeys.

If disabling the HUD doesn't work, open and close the teleport menu (R on the keyboard / SELECT (Playstation) / View Button(Xbox)) while in the hub.

Current problems:

-Freezing the world also freezes some lighting components related to the character. If you want to just roam around with the free camera, I recommend NOT pausing the world.

-Depth of field breaks when the camera is decoupled, so it is disabled automatically when you engage the free camera.
